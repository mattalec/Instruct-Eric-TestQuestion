# Instruct Junior PHP Developer Code Challenge (v1.0)

Instruct-ERIC provides scientific services to researchers around the world, and this is made available
to people through a Service Catalogue. This catalogue allows a researcher to find out what services are
available to them in a given country, and which research centre provides it.

## The Task

In this directory you'll see a file `services.csv`, which contains a small sample of our service catalogue.

1. Create a PHP command line (CLI) program that will allow us to query this data based on COUNTRY CODE 
   (e.g. allow us to display all services provided by Germany)
2. The CLI should also be able to produce a summary output, showing the total number of services in each
   country.

This CLI program should format this output in a useful way, and you are free to use any libraries you 
think would help you (you might find the symfony CLI components useful for this).

## How much time do I have?

We expect this to take no longer than a couple of hours, but feel free to take less or more time as you
see fit. 

## Our expectations

We expect readable, commented and maintainable code as a result. You should think of this as being
a merge request for a production system, so your code should be readily understandable by another
developer - we value readability over cleverness!

Think about how you could make your code reusable, e.g. by putting the logic into reusable classes, and
what tests you could write in order to demonstrate your code works correctly (hint: take a look at PHP Unit).

You can use whatever tools you are familiar with, and can use any libraries you feel necessary, however
the final submission must be developed in PHP 7 or above.

We will evaluate your submission on:

 * Correctness
 * Completeness
 * Quality

## Deliverables

 * Please provide an invite link and code to a GitHub or GitLab repository containing your code
 * This repo should include instructions for running the software
 * Do not submit any binaries or /vendor/ directories

Good Luck!
